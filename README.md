This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli), customized to implement a **modern blog-style UI** with drawers, cards, icons, and content sections.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

Metro is the JavaScript bundler used by React Native. To start it:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and Run Your App

Open a new terminal window and run the app on your platform:

### Android

```sh
npm run android
# or
yarn android
```

### iOS

Install CocoaPods dependencies first:

```sh
cd ios
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

Then run:

```sh
npm run ios
# or
yarn ios
```

> ðŸ’¡ You can also open the iOS project in Xcode and run directly.

## Step 3: Explore the App Structure

This project includes:

### ðŸ«Ÿ Navigation

* `@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/drawer` for nested left and right drawers
* Custom `Header` component that uses `SafeAreaView` to respect the status bar on iOS

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

* **FeaturedPostCard** with overlay icons, meta info, category & date
* **Featured Slider** section with carousel
* **Travel Tips**, **Most Popular**, **Last Comments** sections

### ðŸŽ¯ Icons

* Icons implemented with [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) or emoji placeholders (can be replaced)

### ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure (recommended)

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FeaturedPostCard.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TravelTipsSection.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PopularPostsSection.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CommentsSection.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DrawerNavigator.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HomeScreen.tsx
â””â”€â”€ assets/
    â””â”€â”€ images/
```

## Step 4: Modify and Extend

Edit `src/components/` to customize UI components.

## Reloading Tips

* **Android**: Press `R` twice or use `Cmd+M`
* **iOS**: Press `Cmd+R` in the simulator

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise:

* Run `npx react-native doctor`
* Delete build caches: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
* Clear Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
